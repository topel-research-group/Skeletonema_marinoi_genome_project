# Statistics for the _Skeletonema marinoi_ strain R05AC genome version 1.1.1

## Genome size
* Initial estimate - **~55 Mb**
* Length of primary contigs - **77,570,344 bp**
* Length of associated contigs - **19,665,801 bp**
* Mitochondrial genome - **43,586 bp (circularised)**
* Plastid genome - **127,202 bp (circularised)**

## Contigs
* Primary - **385**
* Associated - **211**
* Organelles - **2** (mitochondrion + plastid)

## Gene models
* Primary - **22,440**
  * Manual curation has been performed to try and ensure one model per locus
  * Of which 41 are over 10kb (excluding introns)
* Associated - **5,418**
  * No manual curation has been performed, so multiple models still remain at each locus
  * 69 of the associated models have no BLAST hits to the primary models
