# Statistics for the _Skeletonema marinoi_ strain R05AC genome version 1.1.1

## Genome size
* Initial estimate - **~55 Mb**
* Length of primary contigs - **77,570,344 bp**
* Length of associated contigs - **19,665,801 bp**
* Mitochondrial genome - **43,586 bp (circularised)**
* Plastid genome - **127,202 bp (circularised)**

## Contigs
* Primary - **385**
* Associated - **211**
* Organelles - **2** (mitochondrion + plastid)

## Gene models
* Primary - **22,440**
  * Manual curation has been performed to try and ensure one model per locus
  * Of which 41 are over 10kb (excluding introns)
* Associated - **5,418**
  * No manual curation has been performed, so multiple models still remain at each locus
  * 69 of the associated models have no BLAST hits to the primary models
* Chloroplast - **141**
* Mitochondrion - **39**

# Statistics for the _Skeletonema marinoi_ strain R05AC genome version 1.1.2

This version has had many contigs removed which were either:
* Formed entirely of repeats
* Suspected of being an incorrectly-labelled associated contig

This version has also undergone some name changes:
* Contig names are now prefixed with 'Sm_'
* The plastid genome has been renamed to 'Sm_plastid'
  * The plastid genes have been renamed with the prefix 'Sm_plastid_'
* The mitochondrial genome has been renamed to 'Sm_mitochondrion'
  * The mitochondrial genes have been renamed with the prefix 'Sm_mito_'

## Genome size
* Initial estimate - **~55 Mb**
* Length of primary contigs - **54,623,658 bp**
  * 54,794,446 bp including organelles
* __Associated contigs not included in this version__
* Organellar genomes - see above
* NG50: 1,237,151 bp

## Contigs
* Primary - **81**
* Organelles - **2** (mitochondrion + plastid)

## Gene models (UPDATE!)
* Primary - **17,203**
